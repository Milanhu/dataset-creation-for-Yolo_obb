# dataset-creation-for-Yolo_obb
This repository's goal is to create datasets for Yolo-obb (oriented bounding box) from existing datasets that contain only axis-aligned bounding boxes. 

After the new dataset has been created, we can train the base Yolo-obb model of choice on it, acquiring a better-performing model for our use case.
